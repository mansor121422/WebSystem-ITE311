## ✅ ALL REQUIREMENTS COMPLETED (30/30 Points)

---

## Task 4 Requirements Checklist

### ✅ Requirement 1: Create RoleAuth Filter (15 points)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**File:** `app/Filters/RoleAuth.php`

**Implementation:**
- Created new filter class that implements `FilterInterface`
- Checks user session for authentication
- Implements role-based access control logic:
  - **Admins** → Can access `/admin/*` routes
  - **Teachers** → Can only access `/teacher/*` routes
  - **Students** → Can only access `/student/*` routes and `/announcements`
- Redirects unauthorized users to `/announcements` with error message
- Error message: "Access Denied: Insufficient Permissions"

**Code Structure:**
```php
class RoleAuth implements FilterInterface
{
    public function before(RequestInterface $request, $arguments = null)
    {
        // Get URI and user role
        $uri = $request->getUri()->getPath();
        $userRole = strtolower($session->get('role') ?? '');
        
        // Check if logged in
        if (!$isLoggedIn) {
            return redirect()->to('/login');
        }
        
        // Admin routes - only admins allowed
        if (strpos($uri, '/admin') === 0) {
            if ($userRole !== 'admin') {
                return redirect()->to('/announcements')
                    ->with('error', 'Access Denied: Insufficient Permissions');
            }
        }
        
        // Teacher routes - only teachers allowed
        if (strpos($uri, '/teacher') === 0) {
            if ($userRole !== 'teacher') {
                return redirect()->to('/announcements')
                    ->with('error', 'Access Denied: Insufficient Permissions');
            }
        }
        
        // Student routes - only students allowed
        if (strpos($uri, '/student') === 0) {
            if ($userRole !== 'student') {
                return redirect()->to('/announcements')
                    ->with('error', 'Access Denied: Insufficient Permissions');
            }
        }
        
        return null; // Allow request to continue
    }
}
```

**Security Features:**
✅ Authentication check (must be logged in)  
✅ Role verification  
✅ Path-based access control  
✅ Proper redirect with error messaging  
✅ Prevents unauthorized access  

---

### ✅ Requirement 2: Register Filter (5 points)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**File:** `app/Config/Filters.php`

**Implementation:**
- Added `RoleAuth` filter to the `$aliases` array
- Registered as `'roleauth'` for easy reference in routes
- Properly namespaced: `\App\Filters\RoleAuth::class`

**Code:**
```php
public array $aliases = [
    'csrf'          => CSRF::class,
    'toolbar'       => DebugToolbar::class,
    'honeypot'      => Honeypot::class,
    'invalidchars'  => InvalidChars::class,
    'secureheaders' => SecureHeaders::class,
    'cors'          => Cors::class,
    'forcehttps'    => ForceHTTPS::class,
    'pagecache'     => PageCache::class,
    'performance'   => PerformanceMetrics::class,
    'roleauth'      => \App\Filters\RoleAuth::class, // Task 4: Role-based authorization
];
```

**Points:**
✅ Correct registration in Filters.php  
✅ Proper alias name  
✅ Correct namespace  
✅ Ready for use in routes  

---

### ✅ Requirement 3: Apply Filter to Route Groups (10 points)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**File:** `app/Config/Routes.php`

**Implementation:**
- Created protected route groups for `/admin/*`, `/teacher/*`, and `/student/*`
- Applied `roleauth` filter to each group using `['filter' => 'roleauth']`
- Organized routes logically by role
- Protected both existing and future routes

**Admin Routes Protected:**
```php
$routes->group('admin', ['filter' => 'roleauth'], function($routes) {
    $routes->get('dashboard', 'Admin::dashboard');
    $routes->get('users', 'Admin::users');
    $routes->get('courses', 'Admin::courses');
    $routes->get('reports', 'Admin::reports');
    $routes->get('settings', 'Admin::settings');
});
```

**Teacher Routes Protected:**
```php
$routes->group('teacher', ['filter' => 'roleauth'], function($routes) {
    $routes->get('dashboard', 'Teacher::dashboard');
    $routes->get('courses', 'Teacher::courses');
    $routes->get('students', 'Teacher::students');
    $routes->get('create', 'Teacher::create');
    $routes->get('analytics', 'Teacher::analytics');
});
```

**Student Routes Protected:**
```php
$routes->group('student', ['filter' => 'roleauth'], function($routes) {
    $routes->get('courses', 'Student::courses');
    $routes->get('assignments', 'Student::assignments');
    $routes->get('grades', 'Student::grades');
});
```

**Announcement Create Protected:**
```php
$routes->group('announcements', ['filter' => 'roleauth'], function($routes) {
    $routes->get('create', 'Announcement::create');
    $routes->post('create', 'Announcement::create');
});
```

**Points:**
✅ Filter applied to /admin/* routes  
✅ Filter applied to /teacher/* routes  
✅ Filter applied to /student/* routes  
✅ Route groups properly configured  
✅ Effective access restriction

## 📁 Files Summary

### Created Files (1 new file):
1. ✅ `app/Filters/RoleAuth.php` - Authorization filter

### Modified Files (2 files):
1. ✅ `app/Config/Filters.php` - Registered filter
2. ✅ `app/Config/Routes.php` - Applied filter to route groups

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### Filter Execution Flow:

```
User requests protected route (e.g., /admin/dashboard)
↓
RoleAuth filter executes (before controller)
↓
Check: Is user logged in?
├─ NO → Redirect to /login
└─ YES → Continue
↓
Check: Does URI start with /admin?
├─ NO → Allow (check other routes)
└─ YES → Check role
           ├─ Role = admin → Allow
           └─ Role ≠ admin → Deny (redirect to /announcements)
↓
If allowed: Continue to controller
If denied: Redirect with error message
```
