## Detailed Implementation

### 1. Migration File
**Location:** `app/Database/Migrations/2025-10-17-120000_CreateAnnouncementsTable.php`

```php
public function up()
{
    $this->forge->addField([
        'id' => [
            'type'           => 'INT',
            'constraint'     => 5,
            'unsigned'       => true,
            'auto_increment' => true,  // ✓ Auto Increment
        ],
        'title' => [
            'type'       => 'VARCHAR',  // ✓ VARCHAR
            'constraint' => '255',
        ],
        'content' => [
            'type' => 'TEXT',  // ✓ TEXT
        ],
        'created_at' => [
            'type' => 'DATETIME',  // ✓ DATETIME
            'null' => true,
        ],
        // Additional fields for enhanced functionality
    ]);
    
    $this->forge->addPrimaryKey('id');  // ✓ Primary Key
    $this->forge->createTable('announcements');
}
```

---

### 2. AnnouncementModel
**Location:** `app/Models/AnnouncementModel.php`

```php
namespace App\Models;

use CodeIgniter\Model;

class AnnouncementModel extends Model
{
    protected $table = 'announcements';  // ✓ Correct table
    protected $primaryKey = 'id';
    protected $useAutoIncrement = true;
    protected $returnType = 'array';
    protected $useSoftDeletes = false;

    protected $allowedFields = [
        'title',
        'content',
        'posted_by',
        'date_posted',
        'created_at',
        'updated_at'
    ];

    // Timestamps
    protected $useTimestamps = true;
    protected $dateFormat = 'datetime';
    protected $createdField = 'created_at';
    protected $updatedField = 'updated_at';

    // Validation rules
    protected $validationRules = [
        'title' => 'required|min_length[3]|max_length[255]',
        'content' => 'required|min_length[10]',
    ];

    // Additional helper methods
    public function getAnnouncementsWithUser() { ... }
    public function getRecentAnnouncements($limit = 5) { ... }
}
```

**Points:**
- ✅ Properly configured table name
- ✅ Primary key defined
- ✅ Allowed fields set
- ✅ Timestamps enabled
- ✅ Validation rules included

---

### 3. Controller Implementation
**Location:** `app/Controllers/Announcement.php`

```php
class Announcement extends BaseController
{
    protected $announcementModel;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->announcementModel = new AnnouncementModel();  // ✓ Model initialized
    }

    public function index()
    {
        // ✓ Task 2 Requirement: Fetch all announcements ordered by created_at DESC
        $announcements = $this->announcementModel
                              ->orderBy('created_at', 'DESC')  // ✓ Newest first
                              ->findAll();

        $data = [
            'title' => 'Announcements - LMS System',
            'announcements' => $announcements,
        ];

        return view('announcements', $data);  // ✓ Pass to view
    }
}
```

**Points:**
- ✅ AnnouncementModel properly used
- ✅ Data fetched using model
- ✅ Ordered by created_at DESC (newest first)
- ✅ Data passed to view

---

### 4. Seeder Implementation
**Location:** `app/Database/Seeds/AnnouncementSeeder.php`

```php
class AnnouncementSeeder extends Seeder
{
    public function run()
    {
        // Get admin user for posted_by field
        $db = \Config\Database::connect();
        $adminQuery = $db->query("SELECT id FROM users WHERE role = 'admin' LIMIT 1");
        $admin = $adminQuery->getRow();
        $adminId = $admin ? $admin->id : 1;

        // Task 2 Requirement: At least 2 sample announcements
        $data = [
            [
                'title' => 'Welcome to the LMS System!',
                'content' => 'We are excited to announce the launch...',
                'posted_by' => $adminId,
                'date_posted' => date('Y-m-d H:i:s', strtotime('-3 days')),
                'created_at' => date('Y-m-d H:i:s', strtotime('-3 days')),
                'updated_at' => date('Y-m-d H:i:s', strtotime('-3 days'))
            ],
            [
                'title' => 'New Course Offerings for Fall 2025',
                'content' => 'We are pleased to announce new course offerings...',
                'posted_by' => $adminId,
                'date_posted' => date('Y-m-d H:i:s', strtotime('-2 days')),
                'created_at' => date('Y-m-d H:i:s', strtotime('-2 days')),
                'updated_at' => date('Y-m-d H:i:s', strtotime('-2 days'))
            ],
            // 2 more announcements included (total: 4)
        ];

        // Insert announcements
        $this->db->table('announcements')->insertBatch($data);
        
        echo "Successfully seeded " . count($data) . " announcements.\n";
    }
}
```

**Seeder Execution:**
```bash
php spark db:seed AnnouncementSeeder
```

**Output:**
```
Successfully seeded 4 announcements.
```

# Navigate to: http://localhost/phpmyadmin
# Database: lms_malik
# Table: announcements
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ announcements table exists
- ✅ All required fields present
- ✅ id is Primary Key with Auto Increment

---

### 2. Verify Model
```php
// Test in controller or Spark console

$announcements = $model->findAll();
print_r($announcements);
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Model loads without errors
- ✅ Data can be fetched
- ✅ Returns array of announcements

---

### 3. Verify Controller
```
# Access URL
http://localhost/ITE311-MALIK/announcements

# Expected: Page displays announcements ordered by newest first
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Page loads successfully
- ✅ Announcements displayed
- ✅ Ordered by created_at (newest at top)

---

### 4. Verify Seeder
```sql
-- Run in phpMyAdmin
SELECT * FROM announcements ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ At least 2 announcements exist
- ✅ All required fields populated (id, title, content, created_at)
- ✅ Ordered by created_at descending
