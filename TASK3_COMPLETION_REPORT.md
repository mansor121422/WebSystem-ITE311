session()->setFlashdata('success', 'Welcome back, ' . $user['name'] . '!');

// Redirect based on user role
$role = strtolower($user['role']);

if ($role === 'student') {
    // Students redirected to announcements
    return redirect()->to('/announcements');
} elseif ($role === 'teacher') {
    // Teachers redirected to teacher dashboard
    return redirect()->to('/teacher/dashboard');
} elseif ($role === 'admin') {
    // Admins redirected to admin dashboard
    return redirect()->to('/admin/dashboard');
} else {
    // Default fallback (if role not recognized)
