## 🧪 How to Test Everything

### Step 1: Start MySQL (IMPORTANT!)
```
XAMPP Control Panel → MySQL → [Start]
```

### Step 2: Verify Migration
```bash
php spark migrate:status
```

Should show: `2025-10-17-120000_CreateAnnouncementsTable` with migrated date

### Step 3: Verify Seeder (Already Run)
```bash
# Already executed, but you can check:
php spark db:seed AnnouncementSeeder
```

### Step 4: Login and Test
1. Go to: `http://localhost/ITE311-MALIK/login`
2. Login with any account (admin, teacher, or student)
3. Click "Announcements" in navigation
4. Should see 4 announcements ordered newest first

## 🔐 How Login & Dashboard Works

### All Users Go to `/dashboard`

**The system automatically shows the correct dashboard based on role:**

```
Login → /dashboard → Checks user role:
                     
├─ role = 'admin' → Shows Admin Dashboard
│                   - User management
│                   - Course management
│                   - Reports
│
├─ role = 'teacher' → Shows Teacher Dashboard  
│                     - My courses
│                     - Students
│                     - Assignments
│
└─ role = 'student' → Shows Student Dashboard
                      - Enrolled courses
                      - Available courses
                      - Grades
```

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Single route: `/dashboard`
- ✅ Single controller method: `Auth::dashboard()`
- ✅ Single view: `auth/dashboard.php`
- ✅ View detects role and displays accordingly

**No separate routes needed!** The dashboard view handles role-based display automatically.

SELECT id, name, email, role FROM users;
```

### If No Users, Register:
1. Go to: `http://localhost/ITE311-MALIK/register`
2. Create accounts with different roles

### Or Add Manually:
```sql
-- Admin user
INSERT INTO users (name, email, password, role, created_at, updated_at) 
VALUES ('Admin User', 'admin@test.com', '$2y$10$...', 'admin', NOW(), NOW());

-- Student user  
INSERT INTO users (name, email, password, role, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES ('Student User', 'student@test.com', '$2y$10$...', 'student', NOW(), NOW());

-- Teacher user
INSERT INTO users (name, email, password, role, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES ('Teacher User', 'teacher@test.com', '$2y$10$...', 'teacher', NOW(), NOW());
```
