# 🔧 Fix Login Issue - Step by Step Guide

## Problem
You're getting a "Whoops!" error when trying to login because MySQL is not running.

---

## ✅ Solution: Start XAMPP MySQL

### Step 1: Open XAMPP Control Panel
1. Open **XAMPP Control Panel**
2. Look for the **MySQL** service

### Step 2: Start MySQL
1. Click the **Start** button next to MySQL
2. Wait for it to turn green
3. You should see "Running" status

### Visual Guide:
```
XAMPP Control Panel
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Apache  [Stop]  [Admin]  [Logs]    │ ✅ Running
│ MySQL   [Start] [Admin]  [Logs]    │ ❌ Not running (THIS IS YOUR PROBLEM!)
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Should look like this:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Apache  [Stop]  [Admin]  [Logs]    │ ✅ Running
│ MySQL   [Stop]  [Admin]  [Logs]    │ ✅ Running (FIXED!)
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Step 3: Test Your Login

Once MySQL is running, try logging in again:

### For Admin User:
- Email: (your admin email)
- Password: (your admin password)
- **Expected:** Redirects to `/dashboard` showing admin dashboard

### For Student User:
- Email: (your student email)
- Password: (your student password)
- **Expected:** Redirects to `/dashboard` showing student dashboard with courses

### For Teacher User:
- Email: (your teacher email)
- Password: (your teacher password)
- **Expected:** Redirects to `/dashboard` showing teacher dashboard

## ✅ How the Dashboard System Works

The dashboard system is already correctly configured:

1. **Login** → User enters credentials
2. **Authentication** → System verifies user and gets their role
3. **Redirect** → All users go to `/dashboard`
4. **Role Detection** → Dashboard shows different content based on role:
   - `role = 'admin'` → Admin dashboard
   - `role = 'student'` → Student dashboard
   - `role = 'teacher'` → Teacher dashboard

---

## 🔍 Verify Your Users Exist

After starting MySQL, verify you have users in the database:

1. Open **phpMyAdmin** (http://localhost/phpmyadmin)
2. Select your database `lms_malik`
3. Click on the `users` table
4. You should see users with different roles

If you don't have users, you need to register them or add them manually.
