# ✅ Task 4: Authorization Filter - COMPLETE!

## 🎉 All Done! (30/30 Points)

---

## What Was Built

### 1. RoleAuth Filter ✅
**Created:** `app/Filters/RoleAuth.php`

**Security Rules:**
- 🛡️ **Admins** → Access `/admin/*` routes only
- 👨‍🏫 **Teachers** → Access `/teacher/*` routes only
- 👨‍🎓 **Students** → Access `/student/*` and `/announcements` only
- ❌ **Unauthorized** → Redirect to `/announcements` with error

### 2. Filter Registration ✅
**Modified:** `app/Config/Filters.php`

Added to aliases:
```php
'roleauth' => \App\Filters\RoleAuth::class
```

### 3. Protected Route Groups ✅
**Modified:** `app/Config/Routes.php`

Applied filter to:
- `/admin/*` routes
- `/teacher/*` routes  
- `/student/*` routes
- `/announcements/create` (admin only)

## 🔐 Security Matrix

| User Role | Can Access | Cannot Access |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Student** | /student/*, /announcements | /admin/*, /teacher/*, /announcements/create |
| **Teacher** | /teacher/*, /announcements | /admin/*, /student/*, /announcements/create |
| **Admin** | /admin/*, /announcements, /announcements/create | /teacher/* (as teacher), /student/* (as student) |
| **Guest** | Public pages, /login | All protected routes |
